# Caesar-Cipher-in-Python
Caesar cipher is the encryption technique, in which we have to replace each letter in the text by a some other letter at a fixed difference. 

# Example :-
  Plaintext:  Sushanth
  Ciphertext: Vxvkdqwk
  
  Key = 3
  
  
# Concept of Caesar cipher encryption :-
    c = (x + n) mod 26
   where, c is place value of encrypted letter,x is place value of actual letter,n is the number that      shows us how many positions of letters we have to replace.
